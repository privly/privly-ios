About
=====
Privly is a developing set of browser extensions for protecting content wherever it is posted on the internet. This extension allows users to view content on any website, without the host site being able to read the content.

About this App
==============

The privly-ios app has two modes:

Content Posting and Sharing
---------------------------

+ Locally stored applications: The iOS app runs no remote-code.
  + *PlainPost Application*: The PlainPost application supports content injection of web pages from any source domain. Note: the injected web pages do not include external media and code.
  + *ZeroBin Application*: The ZeroBin application encrypts content with a key unique to the URL. Anyone with access to both the host page and the content server will be able to decrypt the content. Anyone without access to the server will be unable to decrypt the content.
+ Generated links can be posted on the Facebook and Twitter social networks.

Content Reading
---------------

+ Privly links can be pulled from the authenticated user's Facebook posts and Twitter tweets. They are then opened in a locally stored application.
